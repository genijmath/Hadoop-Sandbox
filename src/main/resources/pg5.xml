{{Agriculture}}

'''Agriculture''', also called '''farming''' or '''husbandry''', is the cultivation of [[animals]], [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], and other life forms for [[food]], [[fiber]], [[biofuel]], [[drugs]] and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |pages=77– |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, cultures, and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of [[irrigation]], although there are methods of [[dryland farming]]; [[pastoralism|pastoral]] herding on [[rangeland]] is still the most common means of raising livestock. In the developed world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for [[sustainable agriculture]] (e.g. [[permaculture]] or [[organic farming|organic agriculture]]).

Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically [[subsistence agriculture]] in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets. This also led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] which made the traditional practice of recycling [[nutrient]]s with [[crop rotation]] and animal [[manure]] less necessary.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizers]], and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormones]], and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. [[Genetically Modified Organisms]] are an increasing component of agriculture today, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management is targeted as an increasingly global issue that is fostering debate on a number of issues. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifers]], has been seen in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully known.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]] and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]], [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and terminology==

The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', &quot;field&quot;, and ''cultūra'', &quot;[[Tillage|cultivation]]&quot; or &quot;growing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=36|pages=563–595|date=December 2005|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|author=Ulrich G.

Schultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to &quot;produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services.&quot;&lt;ref name=Maine/&gt; This definition includes [[arable farming]] or [[agronomy]], and [[horticulture]], all terms for the growing of plants, [[animal husbandry]] and [[forestry]].&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html|title=Definition of Agriculture|publisher=State of Maine|accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between [[silviculture]] (the management of forests) and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–16|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VMw9VcLT-FYC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=differences+between+forestry+and+agriculture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kP1iwV503o&amp;sig=iRvnrs44kkX1_IFzzsFXPnvNrQE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LFGIUevaHZKPyAGYpIHABw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=differences%20between%20forestry%20and%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Forestry Research: A Mandate for Change|author=Committee on Forestry Research, National Research Council|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1990|isbn=0309042488}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term [[agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80364e/80364E04.htm#Agro-forestry%20and%20forest%20laws,%20policies,%20and%20customs|chapter=Applicability of agro-forestry systems|author=Budowski, Gerardo|publisher=United Nations University|title=Agro-forestry in the African Humid Tropics|editor=MacDonald, L.H.|year=1982|isbn=92-808-0364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], [[fertilizers]], [[pesticides]] and the [[domestication]] of livestock were developed a long time ago, but have made great progress in the past century. The [[history of agriculture]] has played a major role in [[history of the world|human history]], as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide [[social change|socio-economic change]]. [[Division of labor]] in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, which allowed the growth of towns and cities, and the complex societies we call [[civilization]]s.  When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were freed to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible. The total [[world population]] probably never exceeded 15 million inhabitants before the development of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tellier, Luc-Normand|year=2009|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective|publisher=PUQ|page=26|isbn=2-7605-1588-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of agriculture were:  &quot;the average daily number of work hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear increased, and lifespan shortened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The World Until Yesterday, Jared Diamond, page 353. isbn=978-0-670-02481-0&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prehistoric origins ===
[[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is thought to be the world's oldest [[agroecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7546-0958-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of a family improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the family's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20forest-garden%20farms%20of%20Kandy%2C%20Sri%20Lanka.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-92-5-102898-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neolithic ===
{{Further|Neolithic Revolution}}

[[File:Trilla del trigo en el Antiguo Egipto.jpg|thumb|Threshing of grain in ancient Egypt]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] of the [[West Asia]] first saw the domestication of animals, starting the Neolithic Revolution. Between 10,000 and 13,000 years ago, the ancestors of modern cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were domesticated in this area. The gradual transition from wild harvesting to deliberate cultivation happened independently in several areas around the globe.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; Agriculture allowed for the support of an increased population, leading to larger societies and eventually the development of cities. It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title= Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the ability to process grain, and the Near East is the ancient home of the ancestors of [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[pea]]s. There is evidence of the cultivation of [[Common fig|fig]]s in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] as long as 11,300 years ago, and [[cereal]] (grain) production in Syria approximately 9,000 years ago. During the same period, farmers in China began to farm [[rice]] and [[millet]], using man-made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen.&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiber crops were domesticated as early as food crops, with China domesticating [[hemp]], [[cotton]] being developed independently in Africa and South America and the Near East domesticating [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant evolution and the origin of crop species|page=119|author=Hancock, James F.|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j_O9ZnFRNngC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=domestication+of+fiber+crops&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=f5nPotYJ4G&amp;sig=S4kwUczkmxgk-j0qRSR6yv0Padc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LbKFUdTnBOjCyAH4-oGoAQ&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=domestication%20of%20fiber%20crops&amp;f=false|publisher=CABI|year=2012|isbn=1845938011|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of soil amendments, including manure, fish, compost and ashes, appears to have begun early, and developed independently in several areas of the world, including [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile Valley]] and eastern Asia.&lt;ref name=FertMan&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qPkoOU4BvEsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=history+of+fertilizer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4mCIUeTtCKWzygGLxIG4DA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20fertilizer&amp;f=false|page=46|author=UN Industrial Development Organization, International Fertilizer Development Center|title=The Fertilizer Manual|publisher=Springer|year=1998|edition=3rd|isbn=0792350324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Harvester.jpg|thumb|Roman harvesting machine|left]]
[[Squash (plant)|Squash]] was grown in Mexico nearly 10,000 years ago, while maize-like plants, derived from the wild [[teosinte]], began to be seen at around 9,000 years ago. The derivation of teosinte into modern corn was slow, however, and it took until 5,500&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; to 6,000 years ago to turn into what we know today as maize. It then gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=S. Johannessen and C. A.

Agriculture advanced to Europe slightly later, reaching the northeast of the continent from the east around 4000 BC. The idea that agriculture spread to Europe, rather than independently developing there, has led to two main hypotheses. The first is a &quot;wave of advance&quot;, which holds that agriculture traveled slowly and steadily across the continent, while the second, &quot;population pulse&quot; theory, holds that it moved in jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo1-AgRev.html|title= The &quot;Agricultural Revolution&quot;|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also around 6000 years ago, horses first began to be domesticated in the Eurasian [[steppe]]s.

===Bronze and Iron Ages===

Between 2500 and 2000 BC, the simplest form of the [[plough]], called the [[ard (plough)|ard]], spread throughout Europe, replacing the [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. This change in equipment significantly increased cultivation ability, and affected the demand for land, as well as ideas about property, inheritance and family rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cHRvtwTLcMAC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=ard+plough+3500+BC&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PmrGVsnYju&amp;sig=Ng5TQh2RU0gueneClVfVNTCP-qY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jvp1Ufu0AsLbrAGPi4HYCQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=ard%20plough%203500%20BC&amp;f=false|page=28|title=Cambridge Economic History of Europe: Vol. 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages|editor=Michael Moïssey Postan, H. J. Habakkuk, Miller, Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=0521087090}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this period, simple [[digging stick]]s or hoes were used. These tools would have also been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil's nutrients were depleted. However, as the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land became a sustaining practice throughout the world, ards were much more efficient than digging sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World|author=Brian M. Fagan|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2004|isbn=0500051305}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humanity became more stationary, empires, such as the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], arose, dependent upon agriculture to feed their growing populations, and slavery, which was used to provide the labor needed for continually intensifying agricultural processes. Agricultural technology continued to improve, allowing the expansion of available crop varieties, including a wide range of fruits, vegetables, oil crops, spices and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/farming.html|title=Farming|work=Egypt's Golden Empire|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec18.pdf|title=Roman Agricultural History|author=Janick, Jules|year=2008|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; China was also an important center for agricultural technology development during this period. During the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1666-221 BC), the first canals were built, and irrigation was used extensively. The later [[Three Kingdoms]] and [[Northern dynasty|Northern]] and [[Southern dynasty|Southern dynasties]] (221-581 AD) brought the first biological pest control, extensive writings on agricultural topics and technological innovations such as steel and the [[wheelbarrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec12.pdf|format=PDF|title=History of Agricultural and Horticultural Technology in Asia|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-05-23|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient world, fresh products, such as meats, dairy products and fresh fruits and vegetables, were likely consumed relatively close to where they were produced. Less perishable products, such as grains, preserved foods, olive oil and wine, were often traded over an extensive network of land and sea routes. The ancient trade in agricultural goods was well established, with wine traded in the Mediterranean region in the 6th century BC and Rome receiving extensive shipments of grain as tax payments by the 2nd century BC. Huge amounts of grain were transported, mainly by sea, and it was during this period that the subsidization of grain farming began, for the prevention of famine. Ancient Rome was a major center for agricultural trade. Trade routes stretched from Britain and Scandinavia in the west to India and China in the east, and included major crops, such as grain, wine and olive oil, as well as additional products, including spices, fabrics and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=194–196|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9JJdqJ8YGH8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=ancient+grain+trade&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JFp1uVNssy&amp;sig=UtQmRJDuVabOtv1MnH_CR2WWFgo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=836dUeX_GKT7ygGdyoHwDA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20grain%20trade&amp;f=false|author=Lesley Adkins, Roy A.

During the time of the [[Greco-Roman]]s, scholars, including [[Plato]] (428-348 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC), documented farming techniques, including the use of fertilizers. Much of what scholars believed about farming and plant nutrition at this time was later found to be incorrect, but their theories provided the scientific foundation for the development of agricultural theories through the [[Middle Ages]]. Ideas about soil fertility and fertilization remained much the same from the time of Greco-Roman scholars until the 19th century, with correspondingly low crop yields.&lt;ref name=FertMan/&gt; By the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests (330-323 BC), the role of horses had developed, and they played a huge role in warfare and agriculture.

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Crescenzi calendar.jpg|thumb|Agricultural calendar from a manuscript of [[Pietro de Crescenzi]].]]
The Middle Ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and technology. During this time period, monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The [[manorial system]], which existed under different names throughout Europe and Asia, allowed large landowners significant control over both their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or [[serf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|title=Medieval Horticulture/Agriculture|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=2013-04-24|author=Jourdan, Pablo}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, the [[Arab world]] was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed the beginnings of the [[plantation]] system through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec22.pdf|title=Islamic Influences on Western Agriculture|author=Janick, Jules|year=2008|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 900 AD in Europe, developments in [[smelting|iron smelting]] allowed for increased production, leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs, hand tools and [[horse shoe]]s. The plough was significantly improved, developing into the [[mouldboard plough#Mouldboard plough|mouldboard plough]], capable of turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe.

The long-term warming period is generally thought to have occurred mainly in Europe, but other areas of the world experienced shorter warming periods at different times during this period, including China in the 11th and 12th centuries, with similar effects on agriculture.

After 1492, a [[Columbian exchange|global exchange]] of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included [[maize]], potatoes, [[sweet potatoes]] and [[manioc]] traveling from the New World to the Old, and several varieties of wheat, barley, rice and [[turnip]]s going from the Old World to the New. There were very few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] caused population growth around the world, and had a lasting effect on many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/american-indians/essays/columbian-exchange|title=The Columbian Exchange|publisher=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|author=Crosby, Alfred|accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since being introduced by Portuguese in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm |title=Super-Sized Cassava Plants May Help Fight Hunger In Africa|publisher=The Ohio State University|author=Wagner, Holly|accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; maize and manioc have replaced traditional African crops as the continent's most important staple food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/16/default.html|title=Advances in Maize Streak Virus Disease Research in Eastern and Southern Africa|editor=Florence Wambugu and John Wafula|year=2000|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of of Agri-Biotech Applications|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its introduction from South America to Spain in the late 1500s, the potato became an important staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The nutrition boost caused by increased potato consumption resulted in lower disease rates, higher birth rates and lower mortality rates, causing a population boom throughout the [[British Empire]], the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.history-magazine.com/potato.html |title=The Impact of the Potato|journal=History Magazine|author=Chapman, Jeff|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, in the form of [[guano]] imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, in the form of an [[arsenic]] compound used to fight [[Colorado potato beetle]]s. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain caused repetitive regional and national famines when the crops failed: 17 major famines in England alone between 1523 and 1623. Although initially almost eliminating the danger of famine, the resulting dependence on the potato eventually caused the [[European Potato Failure]], a disastrous crop failure from [[potato blight|disease]] resulting in widespread [[famine]], and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Potato-Changed-the-World.html|title=How the Potato Changed History|author=Mann, Charles C.|journal=Smithsonian|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agriculture (Plowing) CNE-v1-p58-H.jpg|thumb|Early 20th century image of a [[tractor]] ploughing an [[alfalfa]] field.]]
By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks and [[cultivar]]s had so improved that yield per land unit was many times that seen in the Middle Ages. The work of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]] created the scientific foundation for plant breeding that led to its explosive impact over the past 150 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingsbury&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of agriculture into its modern form has been possible through a continuing process of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]], with huge advances made starting in the early 19th century. Horse drawn machinery, such as the [[McCormick reaper]], revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] made possible the processing of large amounts of crops. During this same period, farmers experimented with steam-powered machinery, which was found to be expensive, dangerous and a fire hazard. In 1892, the first gasoline-powered tractor was successfully developed, and in 1923, the [[International Harvester]] [[Farmall]] tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, and marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters ([[combine harvester|combines]]), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec32.pdf|title=Agricultural Scientific Revolution: Mechanical|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx|title=The Impact of Mechanization on Agriculture|journal=The Bridge on Agriculture and Information Technology|date=Fall 2011|volume=41|number=3|author=Reid, John F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909 the [[Haber-Bosch]] method to synthesize [[ammonium nitrate]] was first demonstrated; it represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints. In the years after [[World War II]], the use of synthetic fertilizer increased rapidly, in sync with the increasing world population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fertilizer.org/ifa/HomePage/SUSTAINABILITY/Climate-change/A-historical-perspective.html|title=A Historical Perspective|publisher=International Fertilizer Industry Association|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past century agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, [[water pollution]], and [[farm subsidies]].

Intensive agriculture has become associated with decreased soil quality in India and Asia, and there has been increased concern over the effects of fertilizers and pesticides on the environment, particularly as population increases and food demand expands. The monocultures typically used in intensive agriculture increase the number of pests, which are controlled through pesticides. [[Integrated pest management]] (IPM), which &quot;has been promoted for decades and has had some notable successes&quot; has not significantly affected the use of pesticides because policies encourage the use of pesticides and IPM is knowledge-intensive.&lt;ref name=Matson1997/&gt;

===Green Revolution===
{{Main|Green Revolution}}
[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the Green Revolution, is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]
The Green Revolution refers to a series of research, development, and [[technology transfer]] initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s, that increased agriculture production around the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter B.R. |last=Hazell |title=The Asian Green Revolution |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=frNfVx-KZOcC&amp;pg=PA1 |year=2009 |work=IFPRI Discussion Paper |publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst |id=GGKEY:HS2UT4LADZD}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiatives, led by [[Norman Borlaug]], the &quot;Father of the Green Revolution&quot; credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and [[pesticide]]s to farmers.

Synthetic nitrogen, along with mined [[rock phosphate]], pesticides and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields in the early 20th century. Increased supply of [[grain]]s has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced as a part of the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. [[Thomas Malthus]] famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.&lt;ref name=&quot;BumperCrop&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/business/worldbusiness/08farmers.html |newspaper= The New York Times |title=Sometimes a Bumper Crop Is Too Much of a Good Thing |last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |coauthors=Bradsher, Keith |date=8 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past century agriculture has been characterized by enhanced [[productivity]], the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, [[selective breeding]], mechanization, [[water contamination]], and [[farm subsidies]]. Proponents of [[organic farming]] such as [[Sir Albert Howard]] argued in the early 20th century that the overuse of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers damages the long-term fertility of the soil. While this feeling lay dormant for decades, as [[environmental awareness]] has increased in the 21st century there has been a movement towards [[sustainable agriculture]] by some farmers, consumers, and policymakers.

Since the 1990s, there has been a backlash against perceived [[externalities|external]] environmental effects of mainstream agriculture, particularly regarding water pollution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The World Bank|year=1995|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3970311122936|title=Overcoming agricultural pollution of water : the challenge of integrating agricultural and environmental policies in the European Union, Volume 1|accessdate=2013-04-15|author=Scheierling, Susanne M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the organic movement. One of the major forces behind this movement has been the [[European Union]], which first certified [[organic food]] in 1991 and began reform of its [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=European Commission|year=2003|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm|title=CAP Reform|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Decouple#Economics|decoupling]]. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as [[integrated pest management]] and selective breeding. Recent mainstream technological developments include [[genetically modified food]].

In late 2007, several factors pushed up the price of grains consumed by humans as well as used to feed poultry and dairy cows and other cattle, causing higher prices of wheat (up 58%), soybean (up 32%), and maize (up 11%) over the year. Contributing factors included  increased demand for grain-fed animal products from the growing middle classes of countries such as China and India and the diversion of food grain to biofuel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/06/business/06tyson.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/W/Wheat |title=At Tyson and Kraft, Grain Costs Limit Profit|date=6 September 2007 |agency=Bloomberg |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=213343|title=Forget oil, the new global crisis is food |last=McMullen |first=Alia

Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/191279|title=Services sector overtakes farming as world's biggest employer: ILO|author=AP|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=2013-04-24|publisher=The Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2 percent in countries like the US and Canada to over 80 percent in many African nations.&lt;ref name=LaborForce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html|title=Labor Force – By Occupation|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country.

=== Safety ===
[[Image:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor|Fordson]] tractor.]]

Agriculture remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]], and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;aginjury&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_pest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agriculture|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot; /&gt;

The International Labour Organization considers agriculture &quot;one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors.&quot;&lt;ref name=ILO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/standards-and-instruments/codes/WCMS_161135/lang--en/index.htm|title=Safety and health in agriculture|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.&lt;ref name=ILO2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110188/lang--en/index.htm|title=Agriculture: A hazardous work|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=2013-04-24|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has developed the [[Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001]], which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

=== Crop cultivation systems ===
[[File:Paddy fields in India.jpg|thumb|Rice cultivation at a paddy field in [[Bihar]] state of India]]
[[File:Rice terraces.png|thumb|The [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Ifugao]], Philippines.]]
Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm|title=Analysis of farming systems|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in &quot;Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology&quot;. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability&quot;. pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization lead to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;/&gt; Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as [[agroforestry]]. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;

The last century has seen the [[intensive farming|intensification]], [[market concentration|concentration]] and [[economic specialization|specialization]] of agriculture, relying upon new technologies of agricultural chemicals (fertilizers and pesticides), mechanization, and [[plant breeding]] ([[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] and [[GMO|GMO's]]). In the past few decades, a move towards [[sustainable agriculture|sustainability in agriculture]] has also developed, integrating ideas of socio-economic justice and conservation of resources and the environment within a farming system.&lt;ref name=&quot;USDA sust&quot;&gt;Gold, M.V. 1999.

[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/sustagintro.html &quot;Sustainable Agriculture:An Introduction&quot;]. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the development of many responses to the conventional agriculture approach, including organic agriculture, [[urban agriculture]], [[community supported agriculture]], ecological or biological agriculture, [[integrated farming]] and holistic management, as well as an increased trend towards [[agricultural diversification]].

=== Livestock production systems ===
{{Main|Livestock}}
{{See also|List of domesticated animals}}

[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ploughing rice paddies with [[water buffalo]], in Indonesia.]]
Animals, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[donkey]]s, and dogs, are often used to help [[Tillage|cultivate]] fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. [[Animal husbandry]] not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.
Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as [[grassland]] – based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;&gt;Sere, C.; Steinfeld, H.; Groeneweld, J. 1995. [http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents &quot;Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends&quot;]. U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization. Rome. Retrieved 7 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastic (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops. Approximately 68% of all agricultural land is permanent pastures used in the production of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;FAO Database, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[OECD]] member countries. In the U.S., 70% of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee|date=23 April 2002|accessdate=2013-04-06|publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.

== Production practices ==
[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|300px|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices.]]
[[Tillage]] is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Tillage&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Land Preparation and Farm Energy&quot; pp.318–338 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pest control]] includes the management of weeds, [[insect|insects/mites]], and diseases. Chemical ([[pesticide]]s), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical ([[tillage]]), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, [[intercropping]], [[composting]], avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. [[Integrated pest management]] attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Pest&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production&quot; pp.240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, [[manure]], [[green manure]], [[compost]] and mined [[minerals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Soil&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Soil and Land&quot; pp.165–210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a [[fallow]] period.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS nutrient&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Nutrition from the Soil&quot; pp.187–218 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''.

Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in [[managed intensive rotational grazing]], or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or [[pasture]]s.

[[Water management]] is where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Some farmers use [[irrigation]] to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a [[fallow]] year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Water&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Plants and Soil Water&quot; pp.211–239 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

== Crop alteration and biotechnology ==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[Chaser bin]]]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved [[disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]] and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to increase yield many folds by creating &quot;high-yielding varieties&quot;. For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical [[pest control]], growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ruttan |first= Vernon W. |title= Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal= AgBioForum |volume= 2 |issue= 1 |pages= 54–60 |month= December |year= 1999 |url= http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cassman |first= K.

[[Genetically Modified Organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import and/or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93975745_peru-bans-genetically-modified-foods-as-us-lags.htm|title=Peru bans genetically modified foods as US lags|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Current TV|accessdate=2013-05-07|author=Whiteside, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a global treaty, the [[Biosafety Protocol]], regulates the trade of GMOs.

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm|title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops|author=Kathrine Hauge Madsen and Jens Carl Streibig|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2013-05-04|work=Weed Management for Developing Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farmers Guide to GMOs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rafiusa.org/pubs/Farmers_Guide_to_GMOs.pdf |title=Farmers Guide to GMOs|publisher=Rural Advancement Foundation International|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/feb2008/db20080212_435043.htm |title=Report Raises Alarm over 'Super-weeds'|journal=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=13 February 2008|author=Brian Hindo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.&lt;ref&gt;Ozturk, et al., &quot;Glyphosate inhibition of ferric reductase activity in iron deficient sunflower roots&quot;, ''New Phtologist'', 177:899–906, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops protect plants from damage by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aces.uiuc.edu/vista/html_pubs/biotech/insect.htm|title=Insect-resistant Crops Through Genetic Engineering|publisher=University of Illinois|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kimbrell, A.|title=Fatal Harvest: The Tragedy of Industrial Agriculture|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total [[externality|external costs]] for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pretty |year= 2000 |title= An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal= Agricultural Systems |volume= 65 |issue= 2 |pages= 113–136 |doi= 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X00000317 |first1= J |display-authors= 1 |last2= Brett |first2= C. |last3= Gee |first3= D. |last4= Hine |first4= R.E. |last5= Mason |first5= C.F. |last6= Morison |first6= J.I.L. |last7= Raven |first7= H. |last8= Rayment |first8= M.D. |last9= Van Der Bijl |first9= G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tegtmeier |first1= E.M. |last2= Duffy |first2= M. |year= 2005 |title= External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States |journal= The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture |url= http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005/&gt; In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |title=Priority products and materials: assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production|author=International Resource Panel|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|year=2010|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Livestock issues ===
A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said &quot;Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |title=Livestock a major threat to environment |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=2013-04-24|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http%3A//www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |archivedate= 28 March 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation, in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEAD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |last1=Steinfeld |first1=H. |last2=Gerber |first2=P. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=T. |last4=Castel |first4=V. |last5=Rosales |first5=M. |last6=de Haan |first6=C. |year=2006 |publisher=U.N.

=== Land and water issues ===
Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39–50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vitousek&quot;&gt;Vitousek, P.M.; Mooney, H.A.; Lubchenco, J.; Melillo, J.M. 1997. &quot;Human Domination of Earth's Ecosystems&quot;. ''Science'' 277:494–499.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land degradation]], the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO GLADA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bai, Z.G., D.L. Dent, L. Olsson, and M.E. Schaepman|date=November 2008|title=Global assessment of land degradation and improvement 1:identification by remote sensing|publisher=FAO/ISRIC|url=http://www.isric.org/isric/webdocs/docs/Report%202008_01_GLADA%20international_REV_Nov%202008.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN-FAO report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be [[deforestation]], [[desertification]], [[soil erosion]], mineral depletion, or chemical degradation (acidification and [[salinization]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;

[[Eutrophication]], excessive nutrients in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s resulting in [[algal bloom]]s and [[anoxic waters|anoxia]], leads to [[fish kill]]s, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) [[surface runoff|runoff]] and [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] from agricultural land. These nutrients are major [[nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint pollutants]] contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carpenter, S.R., N.F. Caraco, D.L. Correll, R.W. Howarth, A.N. Sharpley, and V.H. Smith|year=1998|title=Nonpoint Pollution of Surface Waters with Phosphorus and Nitrogen|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|pages=559–568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture accounts for 70 per cent of withdrawals of freshwater resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|editor=Molden, D.|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/About_IWMI/Strategic_Documents/Annual_Reports/2006_2007/ca.html|title=Findings of the Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture|work=Annual Report 2006/2007|publisher=International Water Management Institute|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is a major draw on water from [[aquifer]]s, and currently draws from these underground water sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the [[Ganges|Upper Ganges]] and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/stressed-aquifers-around-the-globe/|title=Stressed Aquifers Around the Globe|author=Li, Sophia|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=2013-05-07|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that [[water scarcity]] is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with fewer water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0511sp2.htm|title=Water Use in Agriculture|date=November 2005|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/magazine/0303sp1.htm|title=Water Management: Towards 2030|date=March 2003|publisher=FAO|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pesticides ===
Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimentel pesticide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Pimentel, D. T.W. Culliney, and T. Bashore|year=1996. |url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/pimentel.htm |title=Public health risks associated with pesticides and natural toxins in foods |work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;WHO. 1992. Our planet, our health: Report of the WHU commission on health and environment. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides select for [[pesticide resistance]] in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the 'pesticide treadmill' in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Pest&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and D.E. Sadava. 1994. &quot;Strategies for Pest Control&quot; pp.355–383 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative argument is that the way to 'save the environment' and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAvery&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Avery, D.T.|year=2000|title=Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastic: The Environmental Triumph of High-Yield Farming|publisher=Hudson Institute|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Global Food Issues|url=http://www.cgfi.org/ |title=Home|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;&gt;Lappe, F.M., J. Collins, and P. Rosset. 1998. &quot;Myth 4: Food vs. Our Environment&quot; pp. 42–57 in ''World Hunger, Twelve Myths'', Grove Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and that pesticides simply replace [[good agricultural practices|good agronomic practices]] such as crop rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Pest&quot;/&gt;

=== Climate change ===
{{see also|Climate change and agriculture}}
[[Climate change]] has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harvey, Fiona|date=18 November 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc|title=Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns|journal=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty first century; considering the experience of counties in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture, can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50 per cent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/11374Nile%20concise.pdf Report: Blue Peace for the Nile, Strategic Foresight Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future. For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]]|url=http://cdkn.org/resource/srex-lessons-for-the-agricultural-sector/?loclang=en_gb|title=SREX: Lessons for the agricultural sector|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the soil, and much of the [[methane]] emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as [[rice paddy|rice paddies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Soil Organic Matter&quot; pp. 353–385 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] soils also lose nitrogen through [[denitrification]], releasing the [[greenhouse gases]] [[nitric oxide]] and nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils N&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Nitrogen and Sulfur Economy of Soils&quot; pp. 386–421 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester]] some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;/&gt;

===Sustainability===
{{See also|List of sustainable agriculture topics}}
Some major organisations are hailing farming within [[agroecosystems]] as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boelee, E. (Ed)|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/|title=Ecosystems for water and food security|year=2011|publisher=IWMI/UNEP|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for
more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Molden, D.|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit|format=PDF|publisher=The Scientist|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://croplife.intraspin.com/pesticides/paper.asp?id=461|author=Safefood Consulting, Inc.|title=Benefits of Crop Protection Technologies on Canadian Food Production, Nutrition, Economy and the Environment|year=2005|publisher=CropLife International|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; New technologies have given rise to innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trewavas, Anthony|title=A critical assessment of organic farming-and-food assertions with particular respect to the UK and the potential environmental benefits of no-till agriculture|journal=Crop Protection |year=2004|pages=757–781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agricultural economics ==
{{Main|Agricultural economics}}
{{See also|Agricultural subsidy|Rural economics}}

Agricultural economics relates to the &quot;production, distribution and consumption of [agricultural] goods and services&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/aers/agriculturaleconomics|title=Agricultural Economics|publisher=University of Idaho|accessdate=2013-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, [[subsidies]], [[tariffs]] and other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ Across Commodities|author=Peter J. Lloyd, Johanna L. Croser, Kym Anderson|work=Policy Research Working Paper #4864|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=2013-04-16|date=March 2009|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the 1960s, a combination of import/export restrictions, [[exchange rate policy|exchange rate policies]] and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and developed world. In the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse affects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1|title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers?|author=Kym Anderson and Ernesto Valenzuela|work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901|date=April 2006|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=2013-04-16|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ Across Commodities|author=Peter J. Lloyd, Johanna L. Croser, Kym Anderson|work=Policy Research Working Paper #4864|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=2013-04-16|date=March 2009|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act|title=America's $24bn subsidy damages developing world cotton farmers|author=Glenys Kinnock|date=24 May 2011|accessdate=2013-04-16|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, food costs attributed to [[food processing]], distribution, and [[agricultural marketing]] have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. From 1960 to 1980 the farm share was around 40%, but by 1990 it had declined to 30% and by 1998, 22.2%. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, with the top 20 food manufacturers accounting for half the food-processing value in 1995, over double that produced in 1954. As of 2000 the top six US supermarket groups had 50% of sales compared to 32% in 1992. Although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sexton, R.J. |year= 2000 |title= Industrialization and Consolidation in the US Food Sector: Implications for Competition and Welfare |journal= American Journal of Agricultural Economics |volume= 82 |issue= 5 |pages= 1087–1104 |doi= 10.1111/0002-9092.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy and agriculture ==
Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from [[fossil fuel]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists]&quot;. ''The Independent''. 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the [[Green Revolution]] transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the Green Revolution: Implications for International Grain Markets|author=Robert W.

Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt;

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gas, liquid propane, and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1 percent of the nation's total energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Randy Schnepf |date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and natural gas used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author=Jeremy Woods, Adrian Williams, John K.

Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2 percent of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; [[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;css.snre.umich.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ers.usda.gov&quot;/&gt;

=== Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages ===

[[Image:Hubbert peak oil plot.svg|right|thumb|250px|[[M. King Hubbert]]'s prediction of world petroleum production rates. Modern agriculture is totally reliant on petroleum energy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-6262621.html World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists]&quot;. ''The Independent''. 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.&lt;ref name=UMinnSustainable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misa.umn.edu/Search_and_Ask/FAQ/FeedtheWorld/index.htm|title=Can Sustainable Agriculture Really Feed the World?|date=August 2010|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including [[biopesticides]], plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chge.med.harvard.edu/resource/cuban-organic-farming-experiment|title=Cuban Organic Farming Experiment|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, organic farming may be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.|year=2007|url=http://ccwiki.pbworks.com/f/CAStudy-Barriers-Organic-CIRS-2007.pdf|title= Conventional, Mixed, and &quot;Deregistered&quot; Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California|publisher=California Institute for Rural Studies|accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconditioning of soil to restore nutrients lost during the use of [[monoculture]] agriculture techniques also takes time.&lt;ref name=UMinnSustainable/&gt;

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the [[biochar]] and [[synfuel]] process, which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel ''and'' food, instead of the normal [[food vs fuel]] debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/11082/EGU05-J-11082-2.pdf|author=P.

It has been suggested that some [[Genetically modified organism|transgenic plants]] may some day be developed which would allow for maintaining or increasing yields while requiring fewer fossil-fuel-derived inputs than conventional crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=The Electronic Journal of Environmental, Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=7 |month=June |year=2008 |author=Srinivas |title=Reviewing The Methodologies For Sustainable Living}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of success of these programs is questioned by ecologists and economists concerned with unsustainable GMO practices such as [[terminator seeds]].&lt;ref name=Radel&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Journal of Economic Integration |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |month=June |year=2004 |author= R.

While there has been some research on sustainability using GMO crops, at least one prominent multi-year attempt by [[Monsanto Company]] has been unsuccessful, though during the same period traditional breeding techniques yielded a more sustainable variety of the same crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18124330.700-monsanto-failure.html |newspaper=[[New Scientist]] |location= London |date=7 February 2004 |title=Monsanto failure |accessdate=18 April 2008 |volume= 181 |issue= 2433 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policy ==
{{Main|Agricultural policy}}
[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, [[food safety]] and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=13|title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia|journal=Sustainable agriculture and food policy in the 21st century: challenges and solutions|publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics – Bureau of Rural Sciences|date=October 2010|accessdate=2013-04-22|author=Lindsay Hogan and Paul Morris|url=http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, [[food security]], ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/|title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming...|publisher=European Union|accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
